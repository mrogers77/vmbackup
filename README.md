# vmbackup
Disclaimer:  This project is intended to be useful but is to be used at your own risk.

This is a project using PowerShell to interface with Veeam Backup &amp; Replication FREE edition to automate all your vm backups.  This was setup to work with VMWare ESXi.  I have added a parameter -Platform to allow this to work with Hyper-V as well but I don't have the setup to verify this.
